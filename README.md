project: Fraud Detection

overview: |
  This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in financial datasets
  using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory
  data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation with multiple metrics.

installation_and_setup:
